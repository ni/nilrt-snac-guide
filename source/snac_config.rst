Secure Network Attached Controller (SNAC) Configuration
=======================================================

:ref:`Appendix 1 <appendix-1--nilrt-configuration-guide-for-800-171-compliance--v1-0->`
lists instructions to configure an NILRT system into the most secure
configuration, which we refer to as a *Secure Network Attached
Controller,* or SNAC. This configuration changes the behavior of an
NILRT system and customers must evaluate the impact of this
configuration on their NILRT system.

This document and the analysis of NIST 800-171r3 controls assumes the
device is configured following these SNAC instructions. Any variance
from these instructions will impact the compliance of an NILRT system to
this document.
