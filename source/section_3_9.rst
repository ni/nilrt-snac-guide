3.9.1. Personnel Screening
--------------------------

#. Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system.
#. Rescreen individuals in accordance with [*Assignment:   organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening*].

**DISCUSSION**

Personnel security screening activities involve the assessment of an
individual's conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and
stability (i.e., the individual's trustworthiness) prior to authorizing
access to the system. The screening activities reflect applicable
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
criteria established for the level of access required for the assigned
position.

3.9.2. Personnel Termination and Transfer
-----------------------------------------

#. When individual employment is terminated:

   #. Disable system access within [*Assignment: organization-defined      time period*];
   #. Terminate or revoke authenticators and credentials associated      with the individual; and
   #. Retrieve all security-related system property.

#. When individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions
   within the organization:

   #. Review and confirm the ongoing operational need for current      logical and physical access authorizations to the system and      facility;
   #. Initiate [*Assignment: organization-defined transfer or      reassignment actions*] within [*Assignment: organization-defined      time period following the formal transfer action*]; and
   #. Modify access authorization as needed to correspond with any      changes in operational need due to reassignment or transfer.

**DISCUSSION**

Security-related system property includes hardware authentication
tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification
cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated
individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former
employees and that accountability is achieved for the organizational
property. Security topics at exit interviews include reminding
individuals of potential limitations on future employment and
nondisclosure agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for
some individuals, including in cases related to the unavailability of
supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment.

The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals
who have been terminated for cause. Organizations may consider disabling
the accounts of individuals who are being terminated prior to the
individuals being notified. This requirement applies to the reassignment
or transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of
such extended duration as to require protection. Protections that may be
required for transfers or reassignments to other positions within
organizations include returning old and issuing new identification
cards, keys, and building passes; changing system access authorizations
(i.e., privileges); closing system accounts and establishing new
accounts; and providing access to official records to which individuals
had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.
