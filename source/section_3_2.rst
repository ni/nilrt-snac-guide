3.2.1. Literacy Training and Awareness
--------------------------------------

#. Provide security literacy training to system users:

   #. As part of initial training for new users and [*Assignment: organization-defined frequency*] thereafter; and
   #. When required by system changes or following [*Assignment: organization-defined events*].

#. Update training and awareness content [*Assignment:
   organization-defined frequency*] and following [*Assignment:
   organization-defined events*].

**DISCUSSION**

Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to
system users (including managers, senior executives, system
administrators, and contractors) and measures to test the knowledge
level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training
and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems
to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g.,
telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for
security and the actions required of users to maintain security and to
respond to suspected incidents. The content also addresses the need for
operations security and the handling of CUI.

Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies
inscribed with security reminders, displaying logon screen messages,
generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials,
and conducting awareness events. Literacy training is conducted at a
frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and
policies. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular
basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may
precipitate an update to literacy training and awareness content
include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security
incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

3.2.2. Role-Based Training
--------------------------

#. Provide role-based security training to organizational personnel:

   #. Before authorizing access to the system, CUI, or performing      assigned duties, and [*Assignment: organization-defined frequency*]      thereafter; and
   #. When required by system changes.

#. Update role-based training content [*Assignment: organization-defined
   frequency*] and following [*Assignment: organization-defined events*].

**DISCUSSION**

Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training
based on the assigned duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals
and the security requirements of organizations and the systems to which
personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
system developers, enterprise architects, security architects,
acquisition/procurement officials, software developers, system
developers, systems integrators, system and network administrators,
personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities,
personnel performing independent verification and validation, security
assessors, and personnel with access to system-level software with
security-related technical training specifically tailored for their
assigned duties.

Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and
technical roles and responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and
technical controls. Such training can include policies, procedures,
tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also
provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their
responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within
the context of organizational information security programs.
