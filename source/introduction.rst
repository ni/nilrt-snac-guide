Purpose and Scope
-----------------

This document provides a review of the security controls listed in NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 3 applied to the NI Linux RT software products from NI.
This document assumes a customer-operated NI Linux RT implementation.
The implementation may run on one of the following platforms:

-  NI CompactRIO

-  NI PXI

This document applies only to the operating system on the controllers in these platforms.
It does not discuss the process to secure individual hardware drivers or application software that might be used to interact with the supported platforms.
Contact your NI sales representative to inquire if there are cooperative secure configuration guides for your desired NI driver or Application Software.

Throughout this document, "NILRT" is used to refer to the NI Linux RT operating system.
