Information System Categorization
=================================

FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems establishes three potential impact
levels (Low, Moderate, High) for each of the security objectives
(Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). The impact levels focus
on the potential impact and magnitude of harm that the loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability (C/I/A) would have on
operations, assets, or individuals.

An NILRT system will assume its impact level from the system it is
deployed into. The system owner must analyze the deployment purpose and
determine the impact level that applies. This documentation provides
information for Low, Moderate, and High impact levels.
