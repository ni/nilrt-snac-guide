3.15.1. Policy and Procedures
-----------------------------

#. Develop, document, and disseminate to organizational personnel or   roles, policies and procedures needed to implement security   requirements.
#. Review and update policies and procedures [*Assignment:   organization-defined frequency*].

**DISCUSSION**

This requirement addresses policies and procedures for the protection of
CUI. Policies and procedures contribute to security assurance and should
address each family of CUI security requirements. Policies can be
included as part of the generalized security policy or be represented by
separate policies that address each family of security requirements.
Procedures describe how policies, requirements, and controls are
implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the
object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security
plans or in one or more separate documents.

----------------------------
3.15.2. System Security Plan
----------------------------

#. Develop and document a system security plan that describes:

   #. System boundary and operating environment;
   #. Security requirements, tailoring actions, and implementation;      and
   #. Connections to other systems.

#. Review and update the plan at [*Assignment: organization-defined frequency*].

**DISCUSSION**

System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security
controls. System security plans also provide a high-level description of
how the controls meet those requirements but do not provide detailed
descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System
security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and
implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the
plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is
implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of
documents, including documents that already exist. Effective system
security plans make use of references to policies, procedures, and
additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed
information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements
associated with security programs and maintains security information in
other established management or operational areas related to enterprise
architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering,
and acquisition.

3.15.3. Rules of Behavior
-------------------------

#. Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the   system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected   behavior for handling CUI and system usage.
#. Review and update the rules of behavior [*Assignment:   organization-defined frequency*].

**DISCUSSION**

Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for system users.
Organizations consider rules of behavior for the handling of CUI based
on individual user roles and responsibilities and differentiate between
rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general
users.
