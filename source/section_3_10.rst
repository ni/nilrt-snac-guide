--------------------------------------
3.10.1. Physical Access Authorizations
--------------------------------------

#. Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with   authorized access to the facility where the system resides.
#. Issue authorization credentials for facility access.
#. Review the access list detailing authorized facility access by   individuals [*Assignment: organization-defined frequency*].
#. Remove individuals from the facility access list when access is no   longer required.

**DISCUSSION**

Physical access authorizations apply to employees and visitors.
Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are
not considered visitors. Authorization credentials include ID badges,
identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the
strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable
laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
and guidelines. Physical access authorizations may not be necessary to
access certain areas within facilities that are designated as publicly
accessible.

----------------------------------
3.10.2. Monitoring Physical Access
----------------------------------

#. Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to   detect and respond to physical security incidents.
#. Review physical access logs [*Assignment: organization-defined   frequency*] and upon occurrence of [*Assignment: organization-defined   events or potential indications of events*].
#. Coordinate the results of reviews and investigations with the   organizational incident response capability.

**DISCUSSION**

Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within
organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring
include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e.,
cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help
identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats.
The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls if the access
logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response
capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and
responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or
suspicious physical access activities, such as access outside of normal
work hours, repeated access to areas not normally accessed, access for
unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence access.

---------------------------
3.10.6. Alternate Work Site
---------------------------

#. Determine and document alternate work sites allowed for use by   employees.
#. Employ the following controls at alternate work sites:   [*Assignment: organization-defined controls*].

**DISCUSSION**

Alternate work sites include the private residences of employees or
other facilities designated by the organization. Alternate work sites
can provide readily available alternate locations during contingency
operations. Organizations can define different sets of controls for
specific alternate work sites or types of sites depending on the
work-related activities conducted at the sites. Implementing and
assessing the effectiveness of organization-defined controls and
providing a means to communicate incidents at alternate work sites
supports the contingency planning activities of organizations.

3.10.7. Physical Access Control
-------------------------------

#. Enforce physical access authorizations at [*Assignment:
   organization-defined entry and exit points to the facility where the
   system resides*] by:

   #. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting      access to the facility; and
   #. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [*Selection      (one or more):* [*Assignment: organization-defined physical access      control systems or devices*]; *guards*].

#. Maintain physical access audit logs for [*Assignment:   organization-defined entry or exit points*].
#. Escort visitors and control visitor activity [*Assignment:   organization-defined circumstances requiring visitor escorts and   control of visitor activity*].
#. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices.

**DISCUSSION**

Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals
with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered
visitors. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including
professional security staff or administrative staff. Physical access
devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card
readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs
employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination
thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points,
interior access points to systems that require supplemental access
controls, or both.

----------------------------------------------------------
3.10.8. Access Control for Transmission and Output Devices
----------------------------------------------------------

#. Control physical access to system distribution and transmission   lines within organizational facilities.
#. Control physical access to output from [*Assignment:   organization-defined output devices*] to prevent unauthorized   individuals from obtaining the output.

**DISCUSSION**

Safeguarding measures applied to system distribution and transmission
lines prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering.
Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or the
modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to
control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines
include disconnected or locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets,
protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and wiretapping
sensors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing
output devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or
card reader access controls and allowing access to authorized
individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be
monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using
headphones. Examples of output devices include monitors, printers,
scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and copiers.
