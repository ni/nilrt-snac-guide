------------------------------------------
3.6.1. Incident Response Plan and Handling
------------------------------------------

#. Develop an incident response plan that provides the organization   with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability.
#. Implement an incident-handling capability for incidents that is   consistent with the incident response plan and
   includes preparation,   detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.
#. Update the incident response plan to address system and   organizational changes or problems encountered during plan
   implementation, execution, or testing.

**DISCUSSION**

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated
approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business
functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities.
Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources,
including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access
monitoring, user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain
events. An effective incident handling capability involves coordination
among many organizational entities, including mission and business
owners, system owners, human resources offices, physical and personnel
security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, and
procurement offices.

--------------------------------------------------------------
3.6.2. Incident Monitoring, Reporting, and Response Assistance
--------------------------------------------------------------

#. Track and document system security incidents.
#. Report incident information to [*Assignment: organization-defined   authorities*].
#. Provide an incident response support resource that offers advice   and assistance to users of the system for the handling and reporting   of incidents.

**DISCUSSION**

Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident,
the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary
for forensics as well as evaluating incident details, trends, and
handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of
sources, including network monitoring, incident reports, incident
response teams, user complaints, supply chain partners, audit
monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user and administrator
reports. 3.6.1 provides information on the types of incidents that are
appropriate for monitoring. The types of incidents reported, the content
and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities
reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidelines. Incident information can inform
risk assessments, control effectiveness assessments, security
requirements for acquisitions, and selection criteria for technology
products. Incident response support resources provided by organizations
include help desks, assistance groups, automated ticketing systems to
open and track incident response tickets, and access to forensics
services or consumer redress services, when required.

3.6.3. Incident Response Testing
--------------------------------

Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability [*Assignment:
organization-defined frequency*].

**DISCUSSION**

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their
effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies.
Incident response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through
or tabletop exercises, and simulations. Incident response testing can
include a determination of the effects of incident response on
organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals. The
use of qualitative and quantitative data aids in determining the
effectiveness of incident response processes.

---------------------------------
3.6.4. Incident Response Training
---------------------------------

#. Provide incident response training to system users consistent with   assigned roles and responsibilities.
#. Review and update incident response training content [*Assignment:   organization-defined frequency*] and following [*Assignment:   organization-defined events*].

**DISCUSSION**

Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and
responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the
appropriate content and level of detail are included in such training.
For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize
an incident; system administrators may require additional training on
how to handle incidents; and incident responders may receive specific
training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system
recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes
user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from
external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may
be provided as part of 3.2.2. Events that may precipitate an update to
incident response training content include incident response plan
testing, response to an actual incident, audit or assessment findings,
or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives,
regulations, standards, and guidelines.

3.6.5. Incident Response Plan
---------------------------------

#. Develop an incident response plan that:

   #. Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability,
   #. Describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability,
   #. Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization,
   #. Defines reportable incidents,
   #. Addresses the sharing of incident information, and
   #. Designates responsibilities to organizational entities, personnel, or roles.

#. Distribute copies of the incident response plan to designated incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements.
#. Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing.
#. Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure.

**DISCUSSION**

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated
approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business
functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As
part of the incident response capabilities, organizations consider the
coordination and sharing of information with external organizations,
including external service providers and other organizations involved in
the supply chain.
