3.17.1. Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
-----------------------------------------

#. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the   development, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, operations,   maintenance, and disposal of the system, system components, or system   services.
#. Review and update the plan [*Assignment: organization-defined   frequency*].

**DISCUSSION**

Dependence on the products, systems, and services from external
providers and the nature of the relationships with those providers
present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions
that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the
insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of
malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development
practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or
systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain
risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated
effort across an organization to build trust relationships and
communicate with internal and external stakeholders.

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and
assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions,
developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring
performance against plans. The system-level SCRM plan is
implementation-specific and provides policy implementation,
requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone
or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the
management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the
development or sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission
and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly
across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual
program, organizational, and operational contexts.

--------------------------------------------------
3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods
--------------------------------------------------

Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and
procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply
chain risks.

**DISCUSSION**

The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the
supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available,
including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using
blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using
trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk
assessment can inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most
applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide
protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the
insertion of counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or
backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system life
cycle.

Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to
implement controls, promote transparency in their processes and security
practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of
tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from
untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training,
education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain
risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be
employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans,
documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security
requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation
protection requirements.

-------------------------------------------
3.17.3. Supply Chain Controls and Processes
-------------------------------------------

#. Establish a process or processes for identifying and addressing   weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes.
#. Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks   to the system, system component, or system service and to limit the   harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: [*Assignment:   organization-defined supply chain controls*].

**DISCUSSION**

Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are
employed for the research and development, design, manufacturing,
acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and
disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes
include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping
and handling procedures; personnel security and physical security
programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to
maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures
associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal
of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes
may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external
providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or
processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by
adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out
its core missions or business functions.
