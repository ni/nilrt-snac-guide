===================================================================
Appendix 1: NILRT Configuration Guide for 800-171 Compliance (v1.0)
===================================================================

NI Linux RT (NILRT) is an embedded, general-purpose operating system
based on the Linux kernel and OpenEmebedded package distribution. The
system kernel is enhanced for better real-time scheduling performance in
high-precision IO applications. And both the kernel and distribution are
specialized for use with NI compact RIO (cRIO) and PXIe devices.

This document describes the use of NILRT in the Secured,
Network-Attached Controller (SNAC) configuration: a domain-specific
configuration for high-security environments where compliance to NIST SP
800-171 or similar security standards is required.


.. _design-constraints:

------------------
Design Constraints
------------------

When designing a deployment using the SNAC configuration, consider the
following support constraints.

**Supported Hardware Devices.** The SNAC configuration is verified to
work only on cRIO x64 and PXIe x64 devices, that support NILRT. The
sbRIO family of controllers is not included in the supported set.

**Supported NILRT System Images.** The SNAC configuration is supported
on the NILRT Base System Image 2025.0 and later.

**Device Configuration Utilities.** The SNAC configuration supports
device configuration via direct SSH connection or NI MAX. Configuration
via NI MAX or SystemLink is not supported at this time.

**Supported Software Products.** The SNAC configuration supports the
deployment of the following NI software products.

-  LabVIEW Real-Time 2020-2024
-  NI-DAQmx (PXIe only)
-  NI-DMM
-  NI-Scope
-  NI-DCPower
-  NI-Switch
-  NI-FGEN

**Runtime Software Installation.** While in the SNAC configuration,
software installation to the NILRT system is only permitted from:
the `NI.com <http://ni.com/>`__ core package feed, the NI Offline Feed
Installation tool, or from software sources that have been independently
validated and are controlled by the Integrator. The SNAC configuration
will automatically disable the
noncompliant `NI.com <http://ni.com/>`__ "extra" package feed.

**Connected Machines.** If your application design includes a
network-connected Windows or Linux system that receives data from the
NILRT device (via LabVIEW or otherwise), it must be configured with
a `Wireguard <https://www.wireguard.com/>`__ interface.

**Physical Security.** The SNAC configuration is not intended for use in
system designs which allow unauthorized users physical access the NILRT
system. Integrators are directed to design their application to limit
physical access to the NILRT device's IO to only permitted system
administrators and system maintainers.

**Safemode.** NILRT systems have the ability to boot into a temporary
"Safemode" of operation, where Base System Image and system software
configuration changes can be made. Because this boot configuration is
not secured to the same standards as SNAC, unprivileged users and system
administrators should never direct a NILRT device to reboot into
Safemode as a part of normal operations. System maintainers are still
expected to use Safemode to affect deployment of the NILRT Base System
Image, software installation, and system recovery operations.

**Graphical UI.** Normal NILRT configurations support an optional
graphical desktop interface based on XFCE. This graphical UI is not
intended for use in the SNAC configuration. Integrators are directed to
forbid system administrators from enabling this interface, by policy.

**Application Web Server.** After applying the SNAC configuration, the
LabVIEW Application Web Server will cease to function.


.. _design-overview:

---------------
Design Overview
---------------

The NILRT SNAC configuration is a supported set of runtime configuration
changes to the normal NILRT Base System Image (sometimes called
"Runmode"), to increase system compatibility with NIST SP 800-171
security controls. The configuration: replaces the legacy proprietary
authentication framework with standard Linux tooling, disables the

.. _access-control:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NILRT SNAC configuration substantially changes the system account
management framework from the default NILRT configuration. The legacy
credentials database that coordinates accounts between Safemode and
Runmode, and brokers authorization for some NI network services, is
de-installed and replaced with a PAM-based authentication scheme using
standard Linux tools. As a consequence of this reconfiguration:

-  System Administrators will find the NILRT system to be generally more
   similar to other Linux desktop distributions - aiding the design of
   custom authentication schemes based on common PAM tooling.

-  System credentials are no longer shared between Safemode and Runmode.
   The default login user for Safemode will remain admin. Setting
   the admin account password while in Safemode will not transfer to
   Runmode.

-  MAX connection with the NILRT system will not function once the
   system is in SNAC configuration. Software installation and LV project
   deployment should occur prior to entering the SNAC configuration.


.. _roles--users--and-groups:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Roles, Users, and Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NILRT SNAC configuration recognizes that individuals accessing the
system can be broadly divided into one or more roles.

**System Integrators** are engineering organizations who design hardware
and software solutions using NI LinuxRT devices. Integrating
organizatons may be the solutions end-user or an upstream vendor in
their own right.

**System Maintainers** are individuals who are responsible for
physically manipulating the NILRT device, deploying application
software, re-imaging the device, and performing remedial recovery
actions. Maintainers are expected to have constructive access privileges
to the system, and are directed to use the root login account when
performing system maintenance operations.

**System Administrators** are individuals responsible for the running
configuration and operation of the NILRT device. Administrators are
assigned individual accounts on the NILRT system, and enrolled in
the sudo group. As members of this group, they are permitted to perform
privileged operations via the sudo utility.

**System Auditors** are individuals responsible for collecting or
reviewing system logs. Auditors are assigned individual accounts on the
NILRT system, and enrolled in the adm group. As members of this group,
they are permitted write access to system logs and logging
configuration. Users should never be a member of both
the sudo and adm groups, as it would permit that user to both perform
privileged operations and remove audit records of their operations.

**System Users** are all other individuals who require limited access to
a NILRT system to perform their assigned tasks. These users are
generally unprivileged, and forbidden from being members of any of the
prior access groups.

.. _audit-and-accountability:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Audit and Accountability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Event and access logging is performed by several services in NI LinuxRT.
User processes log their actions by registering them with
the syslog-ng daemon. Kernel processes log actions
to dmesg (`/var/log/dmesg`) and to the audit subsystem (`/var/log/audit/``).
PAM authentication logs are written to (`/var/log/auth.log`).

For information about the default (non-SNAC) logging configuration on
NILRT, reference the
nilrt-docs `section <https://nilrt-docs.ni.com/troubleshooting/logs.html>`__ on
logging.

.. _physical-protection:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Physical Protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When attackers gain physical access to a system, they can nearly always
construct 'root' access. To mitigate against these risks, it is
important that Integrators design their deployments to control physical
access to the NILRT system. Limit personnel access to only System
Maintainers, for the purpose of changing system configuration. Construct
secure system enclosures to limit access to unused I/O ports and
peripherals on the system. And enforce organization policies limiting
the use of removable media to only authorized system maintenance
actions.

.. _system-and-communications-protection:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System and Communications Protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Configuration.** NILRT system configuration communications are secured
by two interfaces. (1) The NI Measurement and Automation eXplorer (MAX)
is used for system maintenance operations and deployment of the NILRT
Base System Image. (2) Subsequent runtime administration of the NILRT
system is performed via SSH access to the system shell. The network
traffic of both interfaces are secured by the NILRT device's OpenSSH
server.

**Application.** System applications employ protection strategies that
are necessarily unique to their mission. For LabVIEW communications,
Integrators are recommended to use the provided Wireguard interface or
an equivalent Wireguard VPN of their own design. Non-LabVIEW
applications may use their own Wireguard interface, OpenVPN, or an
application-level encryption strategy of their own design.


.. _snac-configuration-instructions:

-------------------------------
SNAC Configuration Instructions
-------------------------------

System maintainers are directed to deploy and configure a NILRT system
in the SNAC configuration by performing the following actions. All
action should generally be performed by the System Maintainer, logged
into the NILRT shell as either admin (safemode) or root (runmode).

.. _deploy-the-latest-firmware-and-nilrt-base-system-image-to-the-nilrt-system:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deploy the latest Firmware and NILRT Base System Image to the NILRT system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the host system:

#.  Run NI MAX. Connect to the NILRT system.
    #. Left Tab -> Right click on 'Remote Systems' -> 'Create New'
    #. Add your hardware by discovery, hostname, or ipv4 address.
#.  Select your device in the left tab. Update the device's Firmware (Safemode) image.
    #. Center tab -> 'System Settings' -> Update Firmware.
    #. Select a firmware image versioned "25.0" or later.
#.  Reformat the device's Base System Image (Runmode).
#.  Left tab -> Right-click on your device -> Format Disk
#.  Install the latest NILRT Base System Image. 
    #. Left tab -> Extend your device's drop-down -> Software -> Click the Add/Remove Software button in the center tab
    #. When prompted, choose a Linux RT System Image versioned "2025 Q1".
    #. When prompted to install software packages, de-select "NI-VISA" and "NI-DAQmx".
#.  Set the 'admin' account password.
    #. Select your device in the left tab.
    #. In the center tab, select Set Permissions from the top ribbon.
    #. This password will be used by System Maintainers when the device is booted into Safemode, and is not related to the 'root' user account you will configure later.

.. _connect-the-nilrt-device-to-the-internet:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connect the NILRT device to the internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure NILRT as a SNAC device, some of the following steps require
that the device be able to access the NILRT package feeds
at download.ni.com.


.. _using-ssh--log-in-to-the-nilrt-device-:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using SSH, log in to the NILRT device.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Use an SSH client of your choice to connect to the NILRT device's hostname.
#. Log in using the 'admin' account and the password you previously configured. e.g. `ssh://admin@$hostname`
#. All following steps are performed on the NILRT device, using the SSH shell.


.. _install-the-auditd-kernel-module:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install the Auditd kernel module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent the accidental re-installation of the ni-auth legacy
authentication package, it is important that this step be performed
prior to running the nilrt-snac configuration tool.

#.  Install the auditd package using opkg.

    `opkg update && opkg install auditd`

#.  Create an account-group (adm) for individuals who require access to system logs. It may
    already exist.

    `groupadd --system adm`

#.  Configure auditd to create log files with `adm` group ownership permissions. Edit the
    `/etc/audit/auditd.conf` file to set the `log_group=adm` option.

#.  Give the `adm` group ownership of the auditd configuration file.

    `chgrp adm /etc/audit/auditd.conf`

#.  Restart the audit daemon.

   `/etc/init.d/auditd restart`

Audit logs will be generated within `/var/log/audit/`. Additional auditing
rules can be defined by adding them to
the `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` configuration rule.

Add System Auditors to the `adm` group by modifying their user account's
additional groups.

`usermod -a -G adm $user`


.. _install-system-software-and-deploy-application:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install System Software and Deploy Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the NILRT-SNAC Configuration Tool in the next step, MAX
communication to the device will not be possible. This is your last
opportunity to connect to the system in MAX and install software from
the package feeds or deploy your application. Later configuration is
still possible via direct SSH access to the NILRT shell.


.. _configure-system-logging:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure System Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  Install syslog-ng, if it is not already.

    `opkg install syslog-ng`

#.  Enable persistent log storage.

    `nirtcfg --set section=SystemSettings,token=PersistentLogs.enabled,value="True"`

#.  Restart syslog-ng.

    `/etc/init.d/syslog restart`

The default system logging configuration can be extended to meet mission
requirements by appending configurations to
the `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf` file.

Logs are stored to `/var/log` by default.

Note that storing logs persistently may fill up the NILRT system's disk
space, potentially halting other system operations. Integrators are
directed to periodically retrieve NILRT system logs, store them on
another system, and then clean the logs on the NILRT system.

The additional hardware interrupts generated by storing system logs can
have a measurable impact on a system's real-time performance
characteristics - particularly on cRIO systems. If your application has
impressive real-time performance requirements, consider configuring
syslog-ng to emit logs over the network.


.. _run-the-nilrt-snac-configuration-tool:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the nilrt-snac configuration tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  Install the configuration tool using opkg.

    `opkg install nilrt-snac`

#.  Run the nilrt-snac tool.

    `nilrt-snac configure`

#.  Reboot the system. Note that after rebooting the system, serial
    console will be disabled. SSH is the preferred mechanism to continue
    administrating the system.

    `reboot`

#.  Login as 'root' with no password. 'root' is the new super-user
    account that replaces'admin'.

#.  Change the root account password.

    `passwd root`


.. _configure-privileged-operations-via-sudo:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure Privileged Operations via Sudo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NILRT Base System Image includes the sudo utility: a service to
temporarily escalate user privileges. In the SNAC configuration, system
administrators should be given unprivileged user accounts and the
ability to execute privileged functions using sudo.

Add system administrators' user account is added to the group with
the usermod command.

`usermod -a -G sudo $user`

By default, a log of all sudo commands will be written
to `/var/log/auth.log`.
